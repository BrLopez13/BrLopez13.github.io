     <h3>Scratch Project Take 2 Reflections - 01/02/16</h3>
     <p>I did take steps differently to approach to the second Scratch game. I made my game intentionally different on the complexity of the second game compared to my original first game which was the maze.</p>
     <p>I tried multiple of different features of which I had not impleemented in my first game. Thought this wasn't much of a problem, it still wasn't as complex as I said compared to my maze.</p>
     <p>I wanted to have a game where it was simple enough to feature all of the requirements but more detailed than the ones on the videos. I could have tried more on the game, but I'm not creative enough and wanted it to be simple.</p>

     <h3>Day I  of CS50X - 25/01/16</h3>
     <p>My first impression of the video was that it was interesting and entertaining as a video. I enjoyed the content so far because it isn't too complex but teaches me new information at a pace where it is confortable for me.</p>
     <p>There are some content of HTML and CSS that I haven't yet learned so that may be a problem for. As they claim, the level of skill set varies which is very relieving to me as it won't be too extreme or too simple.</p>
     <p>It will be at a level where I can comprehend and where I can learn new information which is what I'm striving for. I want this to be a learning experience for me. I enjoy learning new things and CS50x will certainly be helpful for me to learn.</p>

      <h3>Hello, World! - 20/01/16 </h3>
      <p>This blog is a self-made one from scratch and the purpose is to show people information about myself. The gain I wish to obtain from doing this blog is to learn more about HTML, CSS, and hopefully other forms of coding such as JavaScript by getting more comfortable with it and to use it with ease.</p>
      <p>I want to expand my knowledge about them more than just simply from regular class, I want to get ahead of the pack and go in a class that will help me do so as I am wanting to get into the field of using computers.</p>
      <p>This Accelerated Computer Science class will be a good chance as I said to assist me in learning a lot more. I don't have the passion of being athletic, attempting to be trilingual, or becoming a photojournalist as much as becoming useful with computers and similar technologies.</p> 
      <p>My current outlook for a future job will involve using technology and I must use this opportunity to hopefully make my dream actually come true because I don't want to be a professional athlete (even though that'd be extremely cool), to be a polyglot, or to be a journalist as much.</p>
