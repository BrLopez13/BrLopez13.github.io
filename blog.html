     <h3>How Encryption Affects Our Lives - 17/02/16</h3>
     <p>I believe that we as citizens of the United States, we have the right to have our content and our data private without the government looking at it. The government shouldn't get involved into getting into a personal life online.</p>
     <p>A case where the government should see a persons data is when a person is dead and the government needs to loook on the phone of the person because he was a terrorist so the FBI can find out the motive of it.</p>
     <p>By releasing information of the NSA, Edward Snowden moral had the justified reasoning to do so. He has to let the US and even the world know about the corrupted spying by the government by wiretapping our phones and getting data sent on the internet.</p>

     <h3>Obama Pledges $4 Billion for CS Education - 03/02/16</h3>
     <p>The benefits of Obama doing this is that this will help the current generation of students into arriving to a changing economy that focuses more and more on technology and computer science.</p>
     <p>A problem that may arise from this is that the economy may shift away from technology when students go to college and later get a career. It can be possible for jobs involving technology to decrese due to a lack of interest or to foreigners taking ours.</p>
     <p>Nonetheless, I still support what Obama is trying to do with helping the future generation of students. It gives them more options to pick a career in a society with the trend of where technology continuously to improve year by year.</p>

     <h3>Scratch Project Take 2 Reflections - 01/02/16</h3>
     <p>I did take steps differently to approach to the second Scratch game. I made my game intentionally different on the complexity of the second game compared to my original first game which was the maze.</p>
     <p>I tried multiple of different features of which I had not implemented in my first game. Thought this wasn't much of a problem, it still wasn't as complex as I said compared to my maze.</p>
     <p>I wanted to have a game where it was simple enough to feature all of the requirements but more detailed than the ones which were in the videos. I could have tried more on the game, but I'm not creative enough and wanted it to be simple.</p>

     <h3>Day I  of CS50X - 25/01/16</h3>
     <p>My first impression of the video was that it was interesting and entertaining as a video. I enjoyed the content so far because it isn't too complex but teaches me new information at a pace where it is confortable for me.</p>
     <p>There are some content of HTML and CSS that I haven't yet learned so that may be a problem for. As they claim, the level of skill set varies which is very relieving to me as it won't be too extreme or too simple.</p>
     <p>It will be at a level where I can comprehend and where I can learn new information which is what I'm striving for. I want this to be a learning experience for me. I enjoy learning new things and CS50x will certainly be helpful for me to learn.</p>

      <h3>Hello, World! - 20/01/16 </h3>
      <p>This blog is a self-made one from scratch and the purpose is to show people information about myself. The gain I wish to obtain from doing this blog is to learn more about HTML, CSS, and hopefully other forms of coding such as JavaScript by getting more comfortable with it and to use it with ease.</p>
      <p>I want to expand my knowledge about them more than just simply from regular class, I want to get ahead of the pack and go in a class that will help me do so as I am wanting to get into the field of using computers.</p>
      <p>This Accelerated Computer Science class will be a good chance as I said to assist me in learning a lot more. I don't have the passion of being athletic, attempting to be trilingual, or becoming a photojournalist as much as becoming useful with computers and similar technologies.</p> 
      <p>My current outlook for a future job will involve using technology and I must use this opportunity to hopefully make my dream actually come true because I don't want to be a professional athlete (even though that'd be extremely cool), to be a polyglot, or to be a journalist as much.</p>
